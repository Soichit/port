This individual project took me a tedious 10 weeks since I’ve built everything from the word suggestion algorithm to a web crawler that crawled articles from www.cnn.com and www.bleacherreport.com to store it in my own database hosted on Azure. It was an incredibly rewarding project, creating a basic search engine from scratch within 10 weeks.",

Then I plotted the longitude and latitude of each marker and labeled them appropriately. On top of that scatter map, I also played around with Plotly to make other data visualizations to help users better understand the data.",

Our job was the front-end part so we took their API with their search engine and implemented a way to see the data visually. We got one of the highest grades in class by spending a total amount close to 100 hours on this project.",

If a player is able to kill their target, they will move onto their next target in their “kill-chain” and keep killing their targets until they are either eliminated themselves or there are 2 remaining players. The last 2 remaining players will fight in a sudden death to see who can approach their opponent faster and hit the “kill” button.",

Our diverse group had many disagreements along the design process, and we never would’ve landed on the solution we had if it weren’t for our different perspectives. This project really helped me learn to communicate, collaborate, and most of all, emphasize to look at the world through the eyes of my teammates and the eyes of our users. We aimed to create a mobile solution that makes every relevant information instantly accessible. We went above and beyond, holding weekly meetings and even when there weren’t any project deadlines that week. One of the challenges was designing for our user persona who was completely blind and required noise cues.",
